# Online-store

**A responsive, front-end–only e-commerce prototype built entirely in a single HTML file.**

##  Overview

**Online-store** is a learning-focused project designed to simulate an online clothing store using **only HTML** (with embedded CSS and JavaScript). It supports *sign-in*, *sign-up*, *password reset (forgot password)*, and includes a *Help Center* page. There's no backend, database, or external dependencies—everything is self-contained for front-end practice.
